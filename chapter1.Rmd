## Exercise 1 
I think this course will be easy for me as I'm familiar with most of the concepts and I have used R studio before. I think a refresher on the topics is still useful as I can't for example remember R syntax and how exactly to use github. This course was listed as an option in my degree's transferable skills section as a course I could take.
